In Java 7, the try-with-resources syntax requires a fresh variable to be declared for each resource being managed by the statement.

In Java 9 there is an additional refinement: if the resource is referenced by a final or effectively final variable, a try-with-resources statement can manage a resource without a new variable being declared:

MyAutoCloseable mac = new MyAutoCloseable();
try (mac) {
    // do some stuff with mac
}
  
try (new MyAutoCloseable() { }.finalWrapper.finalCloseable) {
   // do some stuff with finalCloseable
} catch (Exception ex) { }
